## Description


The Redeo-shop Honda PCX is a scooter developed by Honda. It was produced by Thai Honda Manufacturing. The Honda PCX was first introduced for sale in November 2009.In 2012, the original engine was redesigned to decrease friction, increasing efficiency, and the displacement was increased to 152.9 cc (9.33 cu in).[10] The new engine is based on Honda's eSP (Enhanced Smart Power) design.[11] Honda continues to produce the 125 cc (7.6 cu in) version (with eSP) for export to select markets,[12][13] such as Europe, where local licence requirements favour this engine displacement.
